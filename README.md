pixelated-photobooth
====================

An extremely simple pixelation photobooth (aka camera mirror) program written in Processing 2.

May be useful as a basis for other camera software.
Current versions include a pixelated "8bit" cam and a black and white camera that
attempts to emulate a Gameboy Camera style image.

Try increasing pixel size of the pixelatedphotobooth to get some beautiful abstract video art.

Take a screenshot by pressing the spacebar.
