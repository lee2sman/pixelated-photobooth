pixelated-photobooth
====================

An extremely simple pixelation camera program written in Processing 2.

May be useful as a basis for other camera software. A simpler version of 
the Textual Selfie Station software. This is like an 8bit ish camera.

Try changing the pixel size to get some beautiful abstract video art.

Take a screenshot by pressing the spacebar.
