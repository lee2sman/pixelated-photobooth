pixelated-photobooth
====================

A series of photobooth (aka camera mirror) and camera programs written in Processing 2.

Current software cameras
------------------------
1.  a pixelated "8bit" cam
2.  Gameboy Camera style black and white cam
3.  TV monitor image emulator cam with moving snow
4.  monochrome cam that samples the scene it sees and picks a color to represent it
5.  Chuck Klose style camera
6.  Paint Cam creates sloppy painterly images
7.  a Matrix Style (green ascii text on black background) camera
8.  a Glitch camera (modified. original by Geraldine Juarez)

Take a screenshot by pressing the spacebar. Some programs allow you to change contrast with arrow up/dwn keys.

Try increasing pixel size of the pixelatedphotobooth to get some beautiful abstract video art.

Future camera ideas
-------------------
* various glitch cam modes
* output 300dpi printable images
* a description camera?
* a camera that pulls a random image from the internet of the same scene/type of image you're trying to shoot
* add the selfie textual cam
* a music image processer
* a blackbar or pixelated face cam
* go hogwild and build my own polaroid style print function w/ a zink printer or thermal printer
and more. suggestions welcomed.

To do
-----
1.  add more camera emulators
2.  combine all into a single program
3.  create a simple UI
4.  port to P5.JS (and see if i can get it to work as an app)
4.  build into a camera (possibly with oF on RPi)
