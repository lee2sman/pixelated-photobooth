pixelated-photobooth
====================

An extremely simple pixelation photobooth (aka camera mirror) program written in Processing 2.

May be useful as a basis for other camera software.
Current versions include a pixelated "8bit" cam and a black and white camera that
attempts to emulate a Gameboy Camera style image.
New camera emulates TV monitor image with moving snow.

Try increasing pixel size of the pixelatedphotobooth to get some beautiful abstract video art.

Take a screenshot by pressing the spacebar.

To do: 
1. add more camera emulators and cam programs
2. combine into a single program
3. create a UI
4. build into a physical camera and/or phone app
