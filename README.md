pixelated-photobooth
====================

An extremely simple pixelation photobooth (aka camera mirror) program written in Processing 2.

May be useful as a basis for other camera software.

Current software versions include:
1. a pixelated "8bit" cam
2. Gameboy Camera style black and white cam
3. TV monitor image emulator cam with moving snow
4. monochrome cam that samples the scene it sees and picks a color to represent it

Try increasing pixel size of the pixelatedphotobooth to get some beautiful abstract video art.

Future camera ideas include a description camera, a camera that pulls a random image from the internet
of the same scene/type of image you're trying to shoot, the selfie textual cam, a music image processer,
and more.

Take a screenshot by pressing the spacebar.

To do: 
1. add more camera emulators and cam programs
2. combine into a single program
3. create a UI
4. build into a physical camera and/or phone app possibly w/ oF on RPi
